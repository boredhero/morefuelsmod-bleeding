The purpose of this file is to explain how many of each burnable item in both Minecraft and this mod needs to be in a shapeless crafting recipe to make Fuel Pellets. This is calculated by dividing the burn time of the item in ticks by 2000 ticks. At this point, you will round up one number if there are any decimal places. This method will give you how many of an item you need to put in a crafting table to make the fuel pellets item. From there you may craft concentrated fuel pellets, or fuel pellet blocks, or concentrated fuel pellet blocks to further downsize fuel storage space. Without further ado, here are the amounts.
