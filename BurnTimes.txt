This is the list of burn times for this mod. These are non configurable and will be listed in this order
Item = Ticks or Seconds
Now, to begin.

Algorithm Notes:

For Craftable items like a lever, the burn time is determined by calculating the total burn time of the items used to craft it. 20 Ticks or 1 Second is added per non burnable item. Ie, cobble. So a lever burns for 100 Ticks, or 5 seconds. A lever also needs 1 cobble to make so the burn time for a lever would be 120 Ticks, or 6 Seconds HOWEVER, if an item is not normally burnable but is made burnable in this mod, the time of that items burn will be used instead of a default value of 20 ticks.

For Non-Craftable items, it is based on judgement of what seems reasonable for the item.

When an Item is crafted and the burn time is calculated based on its ingredients, but the crafting recipe produces MORE THAN ONE OF THE ITEM, the total burn time that was calcultaed based on ingredients WILL BE DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THE CRAFTING RECIPE PRODUCES to achieve a fair and even price. This often produces rounding.

To avoid .5 and other partial second timings, all things will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 100. This also helps with the fuel pellet crafting system.
